Geometric Spectral Conjugate Gradient Method for Monotone Vector Fields on Hadamard Manifolds

This package includes Matlab codes for geometric spectral conjugate gradient algorthms.
They are efficient algorithms for approximating a zero of a monotone tangent vector field
on a constant curvature Hadamard manifold. 
The test cases and scripts for running the experiments in paper
"Geometric Spectral Conjugate Gradient Method for Monotone Vector Fields on Hadamard Manifold" 
by Zhi Zhao, Xiaoqing Jin, Zengjian Bai, and Tengteng Yao, are also included.
